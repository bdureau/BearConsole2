<h1>3DR module configuration</h1>
<p>In order to do long range telemetry you will need to replace your bluetooth module by
    a 3DR telemetry module.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Note that your Android device battery must be strong enought to power the 3DR module. Consider using
    an external battery if you have a powerfull module</p>
<p></p>
<p>To program the module you need a TTL cable</p>

<p>a USB adapter (USBC or micro USB depending on your Android device)</p>
<p><img  src="file:///android_asset/help/images/usb_adpter-small.jpg"/></p>
<p>a jst adapter and some jst cables are required</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will need to configure the module so that it works with your altimeter board.</p>
<p>Note that those modules usually come pre-set to work at 57600 bauds. However your altimeter board
by default will work at 38400 bauds so will need to make sure that you are connecting at the correct speed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that 3DR modules comes in pair so you will need to configure both the transmitter and receiver</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CAUTION: make sure that you do not unplug the module while doing the following</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Retrieving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Plug the module in your Android device using an OTG cable or any USB adaptor that can work with
micro USB or type C USB</p>
<p>Then click on [retrieve cfg] this will try to connect to the module using various baudrates until it connects.
It will then retrieve the module config so that you can change it</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Saving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Change the settings that you want to change. Make sure that you have selected a baudrate that will
work with your board and click [Save cfg]. This will save the configuration.
    If any error occur while saving it will abort the save</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that you will need to repeat the same step for each module</p>
