<h1>Bluetooth module configuration</h1>
<p>In order to configure your bluetooth module to connect your altimeter to your phone you will first
    need to configure it so that it works at the same speed as your altimeter board.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following screen will help you to configure a bluetooth module so that you can use it with your board.</p>
<p>Module such as the HC05, HC06 etc ... should work</p>

<p>To program the module you need a TTL cable</p>

<p>a USB adapter (USBC or micro USB depending on your Android device)</p>

<p>a jst adapter and some jst cables are required</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will need to configure the module so that it works with your altimeter board.</p>
<p>Note that those modules usually come pre-set to work at 9600 bauds. However your altimeter board
by default will work at 38400 bauds so will need to make sure that you are connecting at the correct speed.</p>
<p></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CAUTION: make sure that you do not unplug the module while doing the following</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Retrieving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Plug the module in your Android device using a TTL cable and a USB adaptor that can work with
micro USB or type C USB</p>
<p>You will need to select the bluetooth module that you have. If you do not know which one you have
    select the default one or any other one that is compatible. If you cannot use any of the module,
    send me the module references and/or pictures of the module.</p>
<p>Then click on [retrieve cfg] this will try to connect to the module using the default 38600 baud.
    If it fails try again, it will use various baudrates until it connects.
It will then retrieve the module config so that you can change it</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Saving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Change the settings that you want to change such as the module name or speed. Make sure that you have selected a baudrate that will
work with your board and click [Save cfg]. This will save the configuration.
    If any error occur while saving it will abort the save</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that you will need to repeat the same steps for each bluetooth module that you want to configure</p>
